Scripts
=======

These are my personal shell scripts and applescripts. Each was created to automate some small task, so they aren't pretty, but they work for me, and maybe they'll work for you too.

* Rdio
    * nowplaying - If Rdio is playing music, displays the artist and track. Otherwise, displays the hostname
    * playpause - If Rdio is playing music, pause it. Otherwise, play it.
* Clip to BBEdit - Copies selected text in Chrome into a BBEdit document, formatted for archiving
* Save BBEdit Clip - Saves a clip created using the Clip to BBEdit script in a special folder with a relevant filename
* Open URL in Chrome - Opens a selected URL in Chrome
* pim.sh - Displays my calendar and tasks in a nice format
* todotoday.sh - adds a task to my todo list with today's date appended
* trash.sh - moves the given files or directories to the Mac's trash can
